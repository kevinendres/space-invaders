# space-invaders

A clone of Space Invaders made for Ed Keenan's Real-time Software Architecture course at DePaul University. 

To ensure that the game succeeded only because of its architectural design, it was made under the following restrictions:
* No builtin data structures 
** Self coded linked lists were allowed
* No language features beyond primitives (arrays were not allowed)
* All data must be organized and manipulated through object oriented design patterns

My faithful clone of Space Invaders uses 14 design patterns to implement the game. The game features
* Multiple screens (select, gameplay, game over)
* Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
* Hit boxes that can be visually toggled for debugging
* Different point values for different alien types
* High scores
